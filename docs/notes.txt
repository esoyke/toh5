Steps for using repo in Windows within PSCU corporate firewall (only applies while I have repo in GitHub):
    1- Export root PSCU cert. 
       a- From Program Files type 'certmgr.msc'
       b- In left hand side, choose 'Trusted Root Certificate Authorities' > 'Certificates'
       c- Double click 'PSCU Root Certificate Authority' to open cert
       d- Go to Details tab, click 'Copy to File'
       e- Follow Wizard, selecting Base-64 CER as output, save to a local location
    2- Make copy of GIT's ca-bundle.crt (this file is currently found under 'C:\Program Files\Git\mingw64\ssl\certs), save to C:/Users/you
    3- Add root cert to the newly copied ca-bundle.crt. Open file in text editor such as vi, paste contents of root cert to end. Save file.
       -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
       MIIH0zCCBbugAwIBAgIIXsO3pkN/pOAwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQ...etc
       -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    4- Update GIT's config to use new file. Type 'git config --global http.sslCAInfo C:/Users/you/ca-bundle.crt
    5- Restart any GIT clients, such as your integrated IDE.
    6- Test a push to the remote. If connecting to GitHub, it will popup a login dialog for your GitHub login.
